# pw-api-plugin

Playwright plugin for comprehensive API testing and presenting results in a user-friendly manner in the Playwright UI and HTML Report.

## Main Features

- Lightweight library introducing new functions: `apiGet`, `apiPost`, `apiPut`, `apiPatch`, `apiDelete`, `apiHead` and `apiFetch`, designed for testing API requests within the Playwright test framework.
- These functions display detailed API request and response information in the  **Playwright UI**
- Each API request and response will also be included as an attachment in the **HTML Report**. _(Introduced in v1.2.0)_
- The functions support multiple calls within a single test, allowing testing of multiple endpoints as part of the same scenario.

## Usage

### How to Use this Library

This library introduces new functions for the Playwright request methods: `fetch`, `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, `delete`, and `head` within the `APIRequestContext` class. These methods display API request and response information in the **Playwright UI**.

To utilize these functions, include the following import statement at the top of your test file:

```js
import { apiFetch, apiGet, apiPost, apiPut, apiDelete, apiPatch, apiHead } from 'pw-api-plugin';
```

> Note: You do not need to import all seven functions—only those you will use in your tests.

Since API request and response information is displayed in the Playwright UI, these new API functions require an object containing the `request` and `page` fixtures as the first parameter. The remaining parameters will be the same as in the original Playwright request.

For example, if an API call using Playwright's standard `get` is:

```js
const responseGet = await request.get(`${baseUrl}/posts/1`);
```

Then, using the new `apiGet` function, the call will be:

```js
const responseGet = await apiGet({ request, page }, `${baseUrl}/posts/1`);
```


### Examples

```js
// tests/example.spec.ts

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { apiFetch, apiGet, apiPost, apiPut, apiDelete, apiPatch, apiHead } from 'pw-api-plugin';


test.describe('API Tests for https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com', () => {

    const baseUrl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com';

    test('Testing API Endpoints - Perform Single Call for Each CRUD Operation (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)', async ({ request, page }) => {

        // ✔️ Example of apiGet
        const responseGet = await apiGet({ request, page }, `${baseUrl}/posts/1`);
        expect(responseGet.status()).toBe(200);
        const responseBodyGet = await responseGet.json();
        expect(responseBodyGet).toHaveProperty('id', 1);


        // ✔️ Example of apiHead
        const responseHead = await apiHead({ request, page }, `${baseUrl}/posts/1`);
        expect(responseHead.status()).toBe(200);


        // ✔️ Example of apiPost (with request body and request headers)
        const responsePost = await apiPost({ request, page }, `${baseUrl}/posts`, {

            }
        });
        expect(responsePost.status()).toBe(201);
        const responseBodyPost = await responsePost.json();
        expect(responseBodyPost).toHaveProperty('id', 101);


        // ✔️ Example of apiPut (with request body and request headers)
        const responsePut = await apiPut({ request, page }, 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
            data: {
                id: 1,
                title: 'foo',
                body: 'bar',
                userId: 1,
            },
            headers: {
                'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
            },
        });
        expect(responsePut.ok()).toBeTruthy();
        const responseBodyPut = await responsePut.json();
        expect(responseBodyPut).toHaveProperty('id', 1);


        // ✔️ Example of apiPatch (with request body and request headers)
        const responsePatch = await apiPatch({ request, page }, 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
            data: {
                title: 'foo',
            },
            headers: {
                'Content-type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
            },
        });
        expect(responsePatch.ok()).toBeTruthy();


        // ✔️ Example for apiDelete
        const responseDelete = await apiDelete({ request, page }, 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
        expect(responseDelete.ok()).toBeTruthy();

    })


    test('Verify Single API Call Using apiFetch with Default GET Method', async ({ request, page }) => {

        // ✔️ Example of apiFetch (default GET)
        const responseFetch = await apiFetch({ request, page }, `${baseUrl}/posts`);
        expect(responseFetch.status()).toBe(200);
        const responseBodyFetch = await responseFetch.json();
        expect(responseBodyFetch.length).toBeGreaterThan(4);
